# <a name="schemafragment"></a>Dgraph Schema Fragment

While editing your schema, you might find it useful to include this GraphQL schema fragment.  It sets up the definitions of the directives, etc. (like `@search`) that you'll use in your schema.  If your editor is GraphQL aware, it will give you errors if you don't have this available.

Don't include it in your input schema to Dgraph - use your editing environment to set it up as an import.  The details will depend on your setup.

```graphql
scalar DateTime

directive @hasInverse(field: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @search(by: [DgraphIndex!]) on FIELD_DEFINITION

enum DgraphIndex {
  int
  float
  bool
  hash
  exact
  term
  fulltext
  trigram
  regexp
  year
  month
  day
  hour
}
```
