How to use the GraphQL API. Dgraph serves [spec compliant
GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) over HTTP. By
default, GraphQL is served at http://localhost:8080/graphql. Both GET and POST
requests are served.

For POST requests, the body must be "application/json" encoded with the following form.

```graphql
{
  "query": "...",
  "operationName": "...",
  "variables": { "var": "val", ... }
}
```

For GET requests, the query, variables and operation are sent as query parameters in the url.

```
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={...}&variables={...}&operation=...
```

In both cases, only `query` is required. `variables` is only required if the query contains GraphQL variables: i.e. it starts like `query myQuery($var: String...)`. While, `operationName` is required if there are multiple operations in the query; in which case, operations must also be named.

Compressed requests and responses are available with gzip. Set header `Content-Encoding` to `gzip` to post encoded data, and `Accept-Encoding` to `gzip` to receive a compressed response.

When an operation contains multiple queries, they are run concurrently and independently in a single Dgraph transaction.

When an operation contains multiple mutations, they are run serially, in the order listed in the request, and in a transaction per mutation. If a mutation fails, the following mutations are not executed, and previous mutations are not rolled back.
