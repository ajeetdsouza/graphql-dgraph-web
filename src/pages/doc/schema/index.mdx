All the things you can put in your input GraphQL schema, and what gets generated from that.

The process for serving GraphQL with Dgraph is to add a set of GraphQL type definitions using the `/admin` endpoint.  Dgraph takes those definitions, generates queries and mutations, and serves the generated GraphQL schema.  

The input schema may only contain interfaces, types and enums that follow the usual GraphQL syntax and validation rules.  Additional validation rules are called out below.

If you want to make your schema editing experience nicer, you should use an editor that does syntax highlighting for GraphQL.  With that, you may also want to include the definitions [here](#schemafragment) as an import.

## How it Works

With Dgraph you design your application in GraphQL.  You design a set of GraphQL types that describes your requirements.  Dgraph takes those types, prepares graph storage for them and generates a GraphQL API with queries and mutations.

You design a graph, store a graph and query a graph.  You think and design in terms of the graph that your app is based around.
