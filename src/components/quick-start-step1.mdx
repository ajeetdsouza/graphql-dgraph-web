For GraphQL in Dgraph, you just concentrate on defining the
schema of your graph and how you'd like to search that graph;
Dgraph does the rest. You work only with GraphQL and, think in
terms of the graph that matters for your app.

This example is for an app about customers, products and
reviews. That's a pretty simple graph, with just three types of
objects, but it has some interesting connections for us to
explore.
Here's a schema of GraphQL types for that:

```graphql
type Product {
  productID: ID!
  name: String @search(by: [term])
  reviews: [Review] @hasInverse(field: about)
}

type Customer {
  username: String! @id @search(by: [hash, regexp])
  reviews: [Review] @hasInverse(field: by)
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  about: Product!
  by: Customer!
  comment: String @search(by: [fulltext])
  rating: Int @search
}
```

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>
