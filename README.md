### Running

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Adding a page 

Just add a `mdx` file with the `title` on top of the file. Now if you want to add a section which can have more parts then just create a folder and add the `index.mdx` file for the main file and again add a `title` field on top and then add as many files you want `*.mdx`.
