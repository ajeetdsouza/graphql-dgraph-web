### Order and Pagination

Every type with fields whose types can be ordered (`Int`, `Float`, `String`, `DateTime`) gets ordering built into the query and any list fields of that type.  Every query and list field gets pagination with `first` and `after`.

For example, find the most recent 5 posts.

```graphql
queryPost(order: { desc: datePublished }, first: 5) { ... }
```

It's also possible to give multiple orders.  For example, sort by date and within each date order the posts by number of likes.

```graphql
queryPost(order: { desc: datePublished, then: { desc: numLikes } }, first: 5) { ... }
```
