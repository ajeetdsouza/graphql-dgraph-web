  <h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>\n    <p>{`A worked example of how to build a GraphQL API for an App.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`GraphQL, Dgraph and Graphs`}</h1>\n    <p>{`You're familiar with GraphQL types, fields and resolvers.  Maybe you've written an app that adds GraphQL over a REST endpoint or maybe over a relational database.  So you know how GraphQL sits over those sources and issues many queries to translate the REST/relational data into something that looks like a graph.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`You know there's a cognitive jump because your app is about a graph, but you've got to design a relational schema and work out how that translates as a graph; you'll think about the app in terms of the graph, but always have to mentally translate back and forth between the relational and graph models.  There are engineering challenges around the translation as well as the efficiency of the queries.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`There's none of that here.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Dgraph GraphQL is part of Dgraph, which stores a graph - it's a database of nodes and edges.  So it's efficient to store, query and traverse as a graph.  Your data will get stored just like you design it in the schema, and the queries are a single graph query that does just what the GraphQL query says.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How it Works`}</h2>\n    <p>{`With Dgraph you design your application in GraphQL.  You design a set of GraphQL types that describes your requirements.  Dgraph takes those types, prepares graph storage for them and generates a GraphQL API with queries and mutations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You design a graph, store a graph and query a graph.  You think and design in terms of the graph that your app is based around.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's move on to the design process - it's graph-first, in fact, it's GraphQL-first.  We'll design the GraphQL types that our example app is based around, and ... we'll there's no `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`and`}</em>{` ... from that, you get a GraphQL API for those types; you just move on to building the app around it.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`An Example App`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Say you are working to build a social media app.  In the app, there are authors writing questions and others answering or making comments to form conversation threads.  You'll want to render things like a home page for each author as well as a feed of interesting posts or search results.  Maybe authors can subscribe to search terms or tags that interest them.  Navigating to a post renders the initial post as well as the following conversation thread.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Your First Schema`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Here we'll design a schema for the app and, in the next section, turn that into a running GraphQL API with Dgraph.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's version 0.1 of the app, so let's start small. For the first version, we are interested in an author's name and the list of things they've posted.  That's a pretty simple GraphQL type.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`type Author {\n  username: String!\n  posts: [Post] \n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`But defining questions and answers is a little trickier.  We could define `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`type Question { ... }`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`type Answer { ... }`}</inlineCode>{`, but then how would comments work.  We want to be able to comment on questions and comment on answers and even have comment threads: so comments that comment on comments.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`We also want to cut down on the amount of boilerplate we need to write, so it's great if we don't need to say that there's an author for a question, and an author for an answer and an author for a comment - see it gets repetitive!`}</p>\n    <p>{`GraphQL has interfaces that solve this problem, and Dgraph lets you use them in a way that cuts down on repetition.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's have a GraphQL interface that collects together the common data for the types of text the user can post on the site.  We'll need the author who posted as well as the actual text and the date.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`interface Post {\n  id: ID!\n  text: String \n  datePublished: DateTime \n  author: Author!\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Questions are a kind of post (that is, questions have `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`text`}</inlineCode>{`, a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`datePublished`}</inlineCode>{` and were published by an `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`author`}</inlineCode>{`) that also have a list of answers.  Answers themselves answer a particular question (as well as having the data of a post).  And comments can comment on any kind of post: questions, answers or other comments.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`type Question implements Post {\n  answers: [Answer]\n}\n\ntype Answer implements Post {\n  inAnswerTo: Question!\n}\n\ntype Comment implements Post {\n  commentsOn: Post!\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Given that, we care about more than just the posts an author has made.

The post text is an obvious candidate.  We'll want to search that Google-style, with a search like \"GraphQL introduction tutorial\".  That's a full-text search.  We can let the API know that's how we'd like to search posts text by updating the schema with:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`interface Post {\n  ...\n  text: String @search(by: [fulltext])\n  ...\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Let's say we also want to find authors by name.  A hash-based search is pretty good for that.  `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`type Author {\n  ...\n  username: String! @search(by: [hash])\n  ...\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`We'll also add less-than, greater-than-or-equal-to date searching on `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`datePublished`}</inlineCode>{` - no arguments required to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`@search`}</inlineCode>{` this time.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`interface Post {\n  ... \n  datePublished: DateTime @search\n  ...\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`With those directives in the schema, Dgraph will build search capability into our GraphQL API.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We also want to make sure that usernames are unique.  The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`@id`}</inlineCode>{` directive takes care of that - it also automatically adds hash searching, so we can drop the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`@search(by: [hash])`}</inlineCode>{`, though having it also causes no harm.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-graphql\"\n      }}>{`type Author {\n  username: String! @id\n  ...\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Now the GraphQL API will ensure that usernames are unique and will build search and mutation capability such that a username can be used like an identifier/key.  The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`id: ID!`}</inlineCode>{` in `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Post`}</inlineCode>{` means that an auto-generated ID will be used to identify posts.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The only remaining thing is to recognize how GraphQL handles relations. So far, our GraphQL schema says that an author has some questions and answers and that a post has an author, but the schema doesn't connect them as a two-way edge in the graph: e.g. it doesn't say that the questions I can reach from a particular author all have that author as their author.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`GraphQL schemas are always under-specified in this way. It's left up to the documentation and implementation to make the two-way connection, if it exists.
